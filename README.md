# Statistical-Reasoning-2
Seaside Chat Feb 9

## Learning Outcomes
1. Choosing the best statistical test for their data
2. Assess the number of variables, whether their data is discrete or continuous, quantitative or qualitative
3. Learn about the various assumptions that come with certain statistical tests
4. Gain a better understanding of common statistical tests

## Why We Chose This Topic
The world is filled with many different types of data. The variables in the data we collect can be continuous (i.e. body mass of penguins), discrete (i.e. number of years since forest fire), or categorical (i.e. red, green, or blue color in a fish species) Therefore it’s important to know which statistical tests are the most helpful to test your particular hypothesis and determine whether your predictor variables have statistically significant effects on an outcome. 

Let’s say you conducted an experiment or survey and collected a bunch of data. Every scientist in training has sat with a large dataset and felt unsure about which direction to take it. You did all your data cleaning and wrangling, and you hopefully have some question or hypothesis you want to address. Great! Now what? 

Knowing which statistical tests are available and when to apply them is a fundamental skill that scientists should practice. Whether you’re comparing means between two populations, or you want to determine if variance between your groups is different from the variance within each group, statistical reasoning helps you figure out what to do next.
 
Our goal is to provide an accessible blueprint for students to take the next step of their analysis and answer the question: what statistical test should I use to test my hypothesis?


## Key Information
Within the vast variety of statistical tests it is easy to get overwhelmed and become unsure of what to do. While there is no easy way to get to the perfect test, it is possible to narrow down those options by knowing the number and types of the variables you have. 

We will show a flow chart that helps to narrow down your options. Following it does not give a perfect solution but it will help find a helpful test, then it is up to you to find something potentially related to get you where you need.

Then we will show some of the most commonly seen statistical tests, when it is appropriate to use them, what they show, and what assumptions they make. 
The tests we will go through:
1. Regression tests
2. T-tests
3. ANOVA tests
4. Chi-squared tests
